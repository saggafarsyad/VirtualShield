Welcome to the VirtualShield Wiki!

VirtualShield is a prototyping toolkit for Arduino. The toolkit use your Android device to act like Arduino Shield and sensors, such as sending data to Middleware or getting location data. The toolkit can help you learn Arduino with less cost and less code. [**Now, let's get build things!**](https://github.com/saggafarsyad/VirtualShield/wiki/Getting-Started)

## Requirements
* Arduino board/modules
* Android device with Bluetooth support
* Bluetooth module with baud rate 115200 (I recommend HC-05 module)

## Feature
* Internet Shield, send data to your web service
* Sensor Shield, use Android sensors. Only Accelerometer and Location sensor is currently available
* Run in background
